     * Meaning of the 3 integers for each InputType:
     * IT_NONE: This means nothing. In certain cases this is regarded as an
     * unset binding.
     * IT_KEYBOARD: id0 is an SDLKey value.
     * IT_STICKMOTION: id0 - stick index, id1 - axis index, id2 - axis direction
     * (negative, positive). You can assume that axis 0 is the X-Axis where the
     * negative direction is to the left and that axis 1 is the Y-Axis with the
     * negative direction being upwards.
     * IT_STICKBUTTON: id0 - stick index, id1 - button index. Button 0 and 1 are
     * usually reached most easily.
     * IT_STICKHAT: This is not yet implemented.
     * IT_MOUSEMOTION: id0 - axis index (0 -> X, 1 -> Y). Mouse wheel is
     * represented as buttons!
     * IT_MOUSEBUTTON: id0 - button number (1 -> left, 2 -> middle, 3 -> right,
     * ...) 
     *
     * Note: For joystick bindings that are actice in the menu the joystick's
     * index should be zero. The binding will react to all joysticks connected
     * to the system.
