# SuperTuxKart 0.6.3 
SuperTuxKart 0.6.3 is a revival of 0.6.x versions.

It uses PLIB engine, like the original SuperTuxKart 0.6.x series, and it is supposed to be a mix between 0.6.x and 0.7.0.  
It has some tracks/karts from 0.7.0, while still keeping its outdated engine, original tracks, karts, items, weaponsâ€¦

## History
In 2017, a 0.6.3 project was launched but never finished nor launched.

In May 2023, the project is re-launched which causes the release of Alpha-1. Alpha-1 has new/updated karts : Pidgin, Nolok, Wilber and many others.

In June 2023, 0.6.3 Alpha-2 and Alpha-2.2 are released.  
Alpha-2/2.2 updates karts and tracks without any optimization.

In July 2023, Pre-alpha-3 was released. It is the first version to include tracks from 0.7.0.

In August 2023, P1ngvin join the SuperTuxKart 0.6.3, preparing the Alpha-3 version.

In October 2023, the latest official version of SuperTuxKart 0.6.3 (Alpha-3a) was released. It is the first offical version that has changes in source code.

In November 2023, the source code of SuperTuxKart 0.6.3 is added on GitHub.

In January 2024, I've decided to delete SuperTuxKart 0.6.3.  
The development of SuperTuxKart 0.6.3 continued while I was out of the project.

In July 2024, I've decided to re-launch the project.  
When I came back in the SuperTuxKart 0.6.3 Team, I learned that we have more members : DaYoshiistesting (me, Main-developper), P1ngvin (secondary developper), PeppermintPatty (leader of the SuperTuxKart 0.6.3 Project).

Back at the time, I've decided to take a step away from SuperTuxKart 0.6.3 to focus on myself (which I still need to do).

In October 2024, I another time leave the project, to get some rest, until May 2025, when I come back.

## Playing the game 
SuperTuxKart is a kart racing game. Basically you run around the track, and give your best shot at reaching the goal before your opponents.  
The gift-boxes can help you, and nitros can build up your power-boost, so you can grab more than one collectable! But avoid the bananas, since they might give you a nasty surprise.

Controls can be configured from the game.  
Note that the escape key pauses the game and makes you go backwards in menu.

## 3D Coordinates
If you want to make a kart/track or are interested in coding, here are the coordinates pattern compared to 0.7's pattern:

####### SuperTuxKart 0.7.0: X = right, Y = up, Z = forward, heading/yaw = Y (up), pitch = X (right), roll = Z (forward). 
####### SuperTuxKart 0.6.3: X = right, Y = forward, Z = up, yaw/heading = X (right), pitch = Y (forward), roll = Z (up).**

(Will do some changes on this internally).
